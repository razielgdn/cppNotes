# Object oriented programming
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm centered around the concept of "objects," which are instances of classes. It is designed to model real-world entities and relationships, making software design more intuitive and scalable. OOP is characterized by several key principles: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

- Simulate interaction of objects in real-world systems.
- Allows representation of objects in problem domain as software objects. 
- Decreases complexity of software systems.
- Make code reusable, extensible and maintainable.

# Object Model 
## Abstraction
- Abstraction focuses on important & necessary details. 
- Unwanted features are left out.
- eg name of a person without other details (age, weight, etc).
- Helps focus on important characteristics.
- Used to represent real-life objects in software, but without the associated complexity.
- Represented through a class, struct, interface, union or enum.
  
## Encapsulation
- Next step after abstraction.
- Hides the implementation details of a class. 
- The class provides behaviors without revealing the implementation.
- Objects of such classes are easy to use. 
- The internal implementation can be changed without the users' knowledge.
- Implemented through access modifiers in OO languages

## Inheritance


## Polymorphism
