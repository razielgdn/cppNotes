# Constructor
There are invoked automatically during instantiation. Its use is for initialization of a class and doesn't have any return type. A constructor ca be overloaded. 
A default constructor with no arguments is synthesized by the compiler if no an user-defined constructor exists. You should create constructors to a better implementation of an object. Constructors can be overloaded.



# Destructor 
It should be invoked when an object is destroyed. A destructor is used for releasing resources that may have been allocated in the constructor. It can not be overloaded and a destructor has no arguments.
